<p>With over 20 years of classroom experiences, a decade solely dedicated to children with autism,
I am so very pleased to offer an encouraging one on one environment using the language of art
to create and to elevate. My individualized approach allows for experimentation, exploration
and play. Utilizing various mediums and processes along with developing a rich relationship
with your child, I will be able to find distinct ways to boost his/her potential.</p>
<p>Looking forward to working together,</p>
<p>Fran C. Brochstein, Educator of the Visual Arts, Emerita</p>
